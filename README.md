Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project- Andrew Smith
=======

This repository contains information on Andrew Smith's submission for the Data Science track Course 3 project.

The file in the repository named run_analysis.R contains the script which reads the test/train data and formats it into a clean set of data.

These are the steps which are performed in the run_analysis.R script in order to create the cleaned dataset.

<ul>
<li>Install and reference the 'dplyr' CRAN package used later in the script for summarising data</li>
<li>Read in the 'X_test', 'y_test' and 'subject_test' datasets and assign to variables</li>
<li>Read in the 'X_train', 'y_train' and 'subject_train' datasets and assign to variables</li>
<li>Read in the generic data text files which contain the data regarding activity and feature labels</li>
